Configuring the API call 

- Create an env.js file to save the environment parameters required for the queries.
- In this file, create the following lines: 

    export const API_TOKEN = '1234';
    export const API_URL = 'https://your_url_here';

- Replace the API_TOKEN value with your own token.
- Replace the API_URL value with the needed URL.
- Save and keep this file for local use only.
